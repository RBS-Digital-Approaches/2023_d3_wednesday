This will give us a frame for considering general trends in the data, which in \n","turn may better help us understand the specificity of individual texts. For example, clustering might allow us to \n","speak about various subgenres of obituaries. Similarly, it could tell us something about how the _New York Times_ \n","writes about particular kinds of people (their vocations, their backgrounds, etc.). It may even indicate something \n","about how the style of the obituary has changed over time.\n","\n","But how to do it? Visual inspection of the graphs above would be one way. There are a few discernible clusters in \n","it. Consider the division in points that cuts up toward the right from the bottom center of the graph; there's a \n","particularly dense patch of points near the Roosevelts' position as well. But while could slice and dice these \n","points using visual cues for ages, these cues can sometimes be misleading. It would be better, then, to use \n","unsupervised methods to automatically partition our feature space.\n","\n","There are a host of different such techniques available. Below, we'll use **hierarchical clustering**. In \n","hierarchical clustering, each data point is treated as an individual cluster before being successfully merged with \n","its most similar point. Then, this new cluster is merged with another cluster, and the process repeats.
